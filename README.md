## Overview

The **Diabetes Prediction with AI** project leverages a machine learning model to predict diabetes risk. Built with **Streamlit**, the app explains predictions using SHAP and permutation importance while showcasing model performance metrics. This model has not been reviewed by medical professionals; it is developed solely for experimental and testing purposes.
The model was developed based on the ROC AUC metric, while efforts were made to improve the Recall metric when selecting the threshold, as this decision was made due to the medical context.

### Why This Project?

Understanding diabetes risk through data-driven predictions can help identify potential cases early. This project also demonstrates:
- Practical application of machine learning.
- Model interpretability through SHAP and permutation importance.
- Real-world deployment of machine learning models.

## Model
You can learn more about the model in detail from 'notebooks/Model.ipynb'. The `RandomForestClassifier` model was chosen through experimentation and showed the best performance. The required hyperparameters were identified using the `optuna` optimizer. For the model to function, it needs `FeatureEngineering`, `WoEEncoding`, and `ColumnSelector` transformers, which are combined through a pipeline.

### **1. FeatureEngineering**
- **What It Does**: Transforms raw data into a format suitable for machine learning. This includes scaling, encoding, creating new features, or handling missing data.
- **How It Works**: Applies preprocessing techniques (e.g., standardization, encoding) to enhance feature quality.
- **Why We Need It**: Improves model performance by making data easier to interpret for algorithms.

---

### **2. WoEEncoding (Weight of Evidence Encoding)**

The Weight of Evidence (WoE) for a category in a feature is calculated as:


Where:
- `P(Feature = X | Target = 1)`: Proportion of positive cases (`Target = 1`) for the category `X`.
- `P(Feature = X | Target = 0)`: Proportion of negative cases (`Target = 0`) for the category `X`.

### Example:
If a feature `X` has the following counts:
- For `Target = 1` (Positive): `N1`
- For `Target = 0` (Negative): `N0`


Substitute these probabilities into the formula to compute the WoE value for the feature category.

---

### **3. ColumnSelector**
- **What It Does**: Selects specific columns (e.g., numerical, categorical) from the dataset for targeted processing.
- **How It Works**: Filters columns based on provided criteria (e.g., data type, column names).
- **Why We Need It**: Enables flexible and modular preprocessing in machine learning pipelines.
