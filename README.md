## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a person has diabetes based on specific medical attributes. The project aims to:

- Utilize various machine learning algorithms for prediction.
- Compare the performance of different models.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for predictions.

## Installation and Setup

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/UznetDev/Diabetes-Prediction.git
    cd Diabetes-Prediction
    ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Technologies and Versions

- **Python:** 3.8
- **Plotly:** 5.23.0 (for visualization)
- **Pandas:** 1.1.3 (for data manipulation)
